# OSRSTrainerSDK

[Click here to try the Inferno simulation](https://inferno-trainer-beta.netlify.app/)

At the moment, this is an "Inferno" simulator. 

Long term, this will house just the Engine side of the OldSchool SDK. The goal of this project is to have a faithful re-implementation of how Old School Runescape works, both to allow us to become better at the game through simulators, as well as better understand how the game is put together.
